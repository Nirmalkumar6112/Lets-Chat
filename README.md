## ðŸš€ This Application is Deployed in Vercel.
- The `vercel.json` has the vercel deploy config.
 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently the deployed app is not fully functional, there is a major issue in deployment in the server side, will be solved ASAP.
> But Local dev will be working fine without any issues.
 
## The Issue:
  - In Client side, in `chat.jsx` there is a function to connect WebSocket through ws://localhost:4000, in local dev we can connect and works well but in vercel deployment, i am figuring out a way to use the WS link from env variable. Thats the only issue in deployment, if you have any idea to solve, let me know...
